Here's a concise summary for my ToDoMatic application that highlights its key features and technologies:

ToDoMatic Application:

- Created a dynamic to-do list application using React, showcasing proficiency in front-end development.
- Implemented task filtering functionality, allowing users to easily switch between viewing all tasks, active tasks, and completed tasks.
- Integrated nanoid encryption for generating unique task IDs, ensuring secure data handling.
- Utilized useState hook for efficient state management, enhancing performance and scalability.
- Designed a user-friendly interface with responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices.
- Demonstrated proficiency in React components, encapsulating task elements for improved code maintainability.
- Leveraged CSS styling and CSS-in-JS techniques for modern and visually appealing design.
- Implemented error handling for adding tasks, enhancing user experience by providing informative feedback.
- Demonstrated attention to accessibility standards by incorporating aria attributes for improved screen reader compatibility.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
